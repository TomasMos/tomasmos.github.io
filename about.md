# Tic-tac-toe

## This game was developed as part of my CS50AI course from Harvard. On the frontend, pygame is used to create the graphics and GUI. The backend enables a human to make moves and calculates the optimum move for an AI to play. The algorithm employed is minimax with alpha-beta pruning. 


### Gamplay

#### This is the home page, where a human can choose to play as X or O, if one chooses O they play second, X goes first.

#### I chose to play as X and the AI chose the top left corner cell as O.

#### After I played a series of suboptimal moves, the AI has won.

#### This is the AI playing as X.

#### The AI has cornered me with a catch-22, where I cannot prevent losing as there are two winning moves for the AI.
